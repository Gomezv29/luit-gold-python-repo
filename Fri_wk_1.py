# The While loop
#while condition:
 #   do_somthing()
  #  do_somthing2()

counter = 1
while counter < 11:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1 # do not forget to increment the variable in the while loop or else the value will always be 1 and just keep printing out 1
print('Finished!')

# Remember an infinite loop never ends (its condition is always true)
# Remember Increasing by 1 is called incrementation.
